## Set up your R session

1.  Check your working directory, load necessary packages (tidyverse, lubridate), and upload two datasets: the ECOTOX neonicotinoid dataset (ECOTOX_Neonicotinoids_Insects_raw.csv) and the Niwot Ridge NEON dataset for litter and woody debris (NEON_NIWO_Litter_massdata_2018-08_raw.csv). Name these datasets "Neonics" and "Litter", respectively. Be sure to include the subcommand to read strings in as factors.

```{r,  message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
getwd()
Neonics <- read.csv("./Data/Raw/ECOTOX_Neonicotinoids_Insects_raw.csv",stringsAsFactors = TRUE )
Litter <- read.csv("./Data/Raw/NEON_NIWO_Litter_massdata_2018-08_raw.csv",stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```
```{r set up, include=FALSE}
#install.packages("formatR")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 80), tidy = TRUE)
```


## Learn about your system

2.  The neonicotinoid dataset was collected from the Environmental Protection Agency's ECOTOX Knowledgebase, a database for ecotoxicology research. Neonicotinoids are a class of insecticides used widely in agriculture. The dataset that has been pulled includes all studies published on insects. Why might we be interested in the ecotoxicology of neonicotinoids on insects? Feel free to do a brief internet search if you feel you need more background information.

> Answer: Neonicotinoids are now widely used in agricultural as they possess a low mammalian toxicity and are effective for controlling challenging insect soil pests. However, recent studies showed that they have devastating ecological effects. Neonicotinoids are very toxic to pollinators and other beneficial insects. Therefore, it is important to study the environmental impact of neonicotinoids.

3.  The Niwot Ridge litter and woody debris dataset was collected from the National Ecological Observatory Network, which collectively includes 81 aquatic and terrestrial sites across 20 ecoclimatic domains. 32 of these sites sample forest litter and woody debris, and we will focus on the Niwot Ridge long-term ecological research (LTER) station in Colorado. Why might we be interested in studying litter and woody debris that falls to the ground in forests? Feel free to do a brief internet search if you feel you need more background information.

> Answer: Litter and woody debris on the ground may act as a tinder that promotes the start and spreading of forest fires. Despite the negative outcomes of them, woody debris also act as an important role in carbon budgets and nutrient cycling. Additionaly, Wood debris is habitat for many organisms.

4.  How is litter and woody debris sampled as part of the NEON network? Read the NEON_Litterfall_UserGuide.pdf document to learn more. List three pieces of salient information about the sampling methods here:

> Answer: 
 1.Litter and fine woody debris are collected from elevated and ground traps respectively.
 2.The sampling design can be divided into two parts: spatial sampling design and temporal sampling design. Spatial sampling design is to place trap pairs within plots which may be either targeted or randomized, depending on the vegetation.
 3. In temporal sampling design, ground traps are sampled once per year.

## Obtain basic summaries of your data (Neonics)

5.  What are the dimensions of the dataset?

```{r}
dim(Neonics)
```

6.  Using the `summary` function on the "Effect" column, determine the most common effects that are studied. Why might these effects specifically be of interest?

```{r}
summary(Neonics$Effect)
```

> Answer: The most common effects are population, mortality and behavior. These effects are closely related to the population of other species and how neonicotinoids can change the behavior and population of other species.


7.  Using the `summary` function, determine the six most commonly studied species in the dataset (common name). What do these species have in common, and why might they be of interest over other insects? Feel free to do a brief internet search for more information if needed.[TIP: The `sort()` command can sort the output of the summary command...]

```{r}
sort(summary(Neonics$Species.Common.Name), decreasing = TRUE, na.last = TRUE)
```

> Answer: The six most commonly studied species are Honey Bee, Parasitic Wasp, Buff Tailed Bumblebee, Carniolan Honey Bee, Bumble Bee and Italian Honeybee. These species are all different kinds of pollinators. As mentioned above, neonicotinoids are very toxic to pollinators and other beneficial insects. Therefore, studying these can help researchers understand effects neonicotinoids have to pollinators. 

8.  Concentrations are always a numeric value. What is the class of `Conc.1..Author.` column in the dataset, and why is it not numeric?

```{r}
class("Conc.1..Author")
```

> Answer: "Conc.1..Author" is character. Because in the column, some numbers are with characters such as "<1.5", "0.0004/". Vectors are sequence of data elements of the same mode, when some data are characters, the class of vector will become character rather than numeric.

## Explore your data graphically (Neonics)

9.  Using `geom_freqpoly`, generate a plot of the number of studies conducted by publication year.

```{r}
ggplot(Neonics) + geom_freqpoly(aes(x=Publication.Year))
```

10. Reproduce the same graph but now add a color aesthetic so that different Test.Location are displayed as different colors.

```{r}
ggplot(Neonics) + geom_freqpoly(aes(x=Publication.Year, color = Test.Location)) 
```

Interpret this graph. What are the most common test locations, and do they differ over time?

> Answer: The most common locations differ over time. From 1980 tp 1990, lab was the most common one. While from 1990 to 2000, the line of field natural was above the line of lab which means that field natural was the most common one at that time. From 2000 to 2020, lab was the most common test location again.

11. Create a bar graph of Endpoint counts. What are the two most common end points, and how are they defined? Consult the ECOTOX_CodeAppendix for more information. 

[**TIP**: Add `theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))` to the end of your plot command to rotate and align the X-axis labels...]

```{r}
ggplot(Neonics) + geom_bar(aes(x=Endpoint)) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

> Answer: NOEL and LOEL are the two most common end points. NOEL (No-observable-effect-level): highest does (concentration) producing effects not significantly different from responses of controls according to author's reported statistical test. LOEL (Lowest-observable-effect-level): lowest dose (concentration) producing effects that were significantly different (as reported by authors) from responses of controls. 

## Explore your data (Litter)

12. Determine the class of collectDate. Is it a date? If not, change to a date and confirm the new class of the variable. Using the `unique` function, determine which dates litter was sampled in August 2018.

```{r}
class(Litter$collectDate) # factor
Date_Collect <- ymd(Litter$collectDate)
Date_Collect
class(Date_Collect) # Date
unique(Date_Collect)
```

13. Using the `unique` function, determine how many plots were sampled at Niwot Ridge. How is the information obtained from `unique` different from that obtained from `summary`?

```{r}
unique(Litter$plotID)
summary(Litter$plotID)
```

> Answer: 12 plots were sampled at Niwot Ridge. Unique() eliminates the duplicate values, only keep the unique values. Summary() calculates the number of each unique value.

14. Create a bar graph of functionalGroup counts. This shows you what type of litter is collected at the Niwot Ridge sites. Notice that litter types are fairly equally distributed across the Niwot Ridge sites.

```{r}
ggplot(Litter) + geom_bar(aes(x=functionalGroup)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

15. Using `geom_boxplot` and `geom_violin`, create a boxplot and a violin plot of dryMass by functionalGroup.

```{r,fig.width= 10}
ggplot(Litter) + geom_boxplot(aes(x=functionalGroup, y=dryMass)) + 
  coord_flip()

ggplot(Litter) + geom_violin(aes(x=functionalGroup, y=dryMass))+coord_flip()

```

Why is the boxplot a more effective visualization option than the violin plot in this case?

> Answer: In this case, box plot can present each functionalGroup clearly as it only shows the summarized data such as median value, 25th to 75th percentile of data. Violin plot shows all the data which is more informative. However in this case, the maximum value of dryMass is 8.630, while the minimum wvalue is 0.000. The range of value is huge that we barely see the violin part of the chart.

What type(s) of litter tend to have the highest biomass at these sites?

> Answer: Needless
